Hi everyone!  
This repository is where I upload my exercises and experiments while learning Python.  
I’m just starting out, so the code here may not be perfect — but that’s part of the journey! 

I really appreciate any **recommendations, corrections, or tips** from the community.  
If you see something that can be improved, please feel free to open an issue or suggest changes.  

Thanks for stopping by and happy coding!
